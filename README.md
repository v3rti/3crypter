#### This would be the start of a series where I try and make a full working web app every week till the end of 2024 :p. (hopefully I won't abandon this)

3crypter is a tool that I think I'll end up using myself, where I simply write normal text and salt it with a chosen pwd? (this way I'll learn more about cryptography).
